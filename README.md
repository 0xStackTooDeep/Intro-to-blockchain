# Intro-to-blockchain

If you want to learn about web3 and blockchain development then this repo can help you master the technology. This file does not assume your expereince with blockchain development and hence contains material suitable for both begginers and experts. Please use your judgment to find resources relevant to your skill level. Learning is a step-by-step process and diving deep into advanced concepts without a good grasp on fundamentals would never yeild positive results. 

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger which stores transactions in a decentralized, transparent and immutable way. This video by 3Blue1Brown explains clearly how bitcoin works in a beginner-friendly way.

There are a lot different blockchains out there but the two most important are:
- [Bitcoin](#bitcoin)
- [Ethereum](#ethereum)

## Bitcoin
The afferomentioned video by 3b1b is a great place to start for anyone wanting to learn about bitcoin. For folks who want to dive deeper into how the technology works should really read [Grokking Bitcoin](https://rosenbaum.se/book/).
<br>
<br>
This book is perfect for people who want to grasp the cryptography behind how bitcoin works. It does get quite technical after the first few chapters but for anyone wanting to build on any blockchain, it is critical to understand the fundamental workings of bitcoin as it is the inspiration for every blockchain out there.
<br>
<br>
After going through the above resources, you should really play around with a blockchain yourself. [This demo](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/) by Andreas Brownworth is perfect for visualising hashes, blocks, tokens, etc.
<br>
<br>
If you want to learn more about cryptography, you can check out these puzzles on [Cryptohacks](https://cryptohack.org/) and learn about advance concepts like [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/) which are fundamental to how bitcoin, ethereum and other blockchains work.
<br>
<br>
Even if you wish to build for Ethereum, every blockchain developer should go through the above resources and understand the fundamental working of bitcon. If you wish to further learn about the bitcoin ecosystem, the next best resource every bitcoin developer should study is [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) written by Andreas M. Antonopoulos.
<br>
<br>
This amount of knowledge is enough for you to start contributing in open-source projects and apply for programmes like [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/).
