# Intro-to-blockchain

If you want to learn about web3 and blockchain development then this repo can help you master the technology. This file does not assume your expereince with blockchain development and hence contains material suitable for both begginers and experts. Please use your judgment to find resources relevant to your skill level. Learning is a step-by-step process and diving deep into advanced concepts without a good grasp on fundamentals would never yeild positive results. 

## What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed ledger which stores transactions in a decentralized, transparent and immutable way. This video by 3Blue1Brown explains clearly how bitcoin works in a beginner-friendly way.

<br>

There are a lot different blockchains out there but the two most important are:
- [Bitcoin](#bitcoin)
- [Ethereum](#ethereum)

## Bitcoin
The afferomentioned video by 3b1b is a great place to start for anyone wanting to learn about bitcoin. For folks who want to dive deeper into how the technology works should really read [Grokking Bitcoin](https://rosenbaum.se/book/).
<br>
Understanding the [Bitcoin Whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) is also important along side GB.
<br>
<br>
This book is perfect for people who want to grasp the cryptography behind how bitcoin works. It does get quite technical after the first few chapters but for anyone wanting to build on any blockchain, it is critical to understand the fundamental workings of bitcoin as it is the inspiration for every blockchain out there.
<br>
<br>
After going through the above resources, you should really play around with a blockchain yourself. [This demo](https://andersbrownworth.com/blockchain/) by Andreas Brownworth is perfect for visualising hashes, blocks, tokens, etc.
<br>
<br>
If you want to learn more about cryptography, you can check out these puzzles on [Cryptohacks](https://cryptohack.org/) and learn about advance concepts like [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/) which are fundamental to how bitcoin, ethereum and other blockchains work.
<br>
<br>
Even if you wish to build for Ethereum, every blockchain developer should go through the above resources and understand the fundamental working of bitcon. If you wish to further learn about the bitcoin ecosystem, the next best resource every bitcoin developer should study is [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) written by Andreas M. Antonopoulos.
<br>
<br>
This amount of knowledge is enough for you to start contributing in open-source projects and apply for programmes like [Summer of Bitcoin](https://www.summerofbitcoin.org/).
<br>
## Ethereum
Bitcoin was created as a decentralised p2p cash system or a 'cryptocurrency'. It was evident that the benefits of a public blockchain could used far beyond just money. Ethereum was developed with the purpose of adding smart contracts onto the blockchain. The EVM is turing complete machine that can run any logic and execute it with the benefits of a blockchain.
<br>
<br>
[Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) has some great articles on understanding the ecosystem. Along with blogs, reading the [Ethereum Whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) also helps in understadning its differences from bitcoin.
<br>
<br>
Understanding the basics of Ethereum is enough to start Dapp development but the EVM is a very complicated and fascinating machine. As a begginer its recommended to stop here and pick it up again after creating some projects. Speaking of projects, becoming an expert Blockchain developer requires mastery in:
- [Web Development](#web2-resources)
- [Solidity and Web3 Ecosystem](#web3-resources)
- [EVM and Security](#evm-and-security)

### Web2 Resources
A Decentralised Application or DApp is just a normal web app with a blockchain like Ethereum serving as its backend. Hence, building a good DApp requires skills in traditional web2 development as well. A DApp consists of smart contracts that can be interacted with through a front-end. Usually these DApps also have backend architechture to handle various SDKs, libraries and even databases.
